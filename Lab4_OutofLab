Please add the lab assignment NUMBER and your NAME at the top of your file sheet. The following table is from Wikipedia. It shows the eleven highest mountains 
in Georgia. 
Brasstown Bald, (summit),4784,feet,Union County 
Rabun Bald, (summit),4696,feet,Rabun County 
Dick's Knob, (summit),4620,feet,Rabun County 
Hightower Bald, (summit),4568,feet,Towns County 
Wolfpen Ridge, (ridge high point),4561,feet,Towns and Union 
Counties 
Blood Mountain, (summit),4458,feet,Union County 
Tray Mountain, (summit), 4430,feet,Towns County 
Grassy Ridge, (ridge high point),4420,feet,Rabun County 
Slaughter Mountain, (summit),4338,feet,Union County 
Double Spring Knob, (summit),4280,feet,Rabun County 
Coosa Bald, (summit),4280,feet,Union County 
In above table, each line contains 5 fields separated by comma. Open your terminal and connect to snowball server. After that, go to directory Lab4 (cd ~/Lab4) and please download the file " mountainList.txt" by the following command (internet access required):
cp /home/frondel1/Public/mountainList.txt mountainList.txt Be sure it succeeds using “ls” to see the file name “mountainList.txt” listed. 
1) Use grep to print all lines where the mountains are at Towns or Union 
County. 
grep -E "(Union|Towns)" mountainList.txt 
1 
Sample Output 
2) Use wc and grep to count the number of mountains located at Rabun 
County. 
grep -o -i "Rabun County" mountainList.txt | wc -l 
Hint: please use pipe | . 
Sample Output 

3) Finish task 2) by using only grep. 
Hint: open the manual page of grep, and check -c option. 
Grep --help 
 -c, --count print only a count of matching lines per FILE
4)A. Type command sed ‘s/ridge high point/r.h.p./p’ mountainList.txt and execute it. Then attach a screenshot of the output. 
B. Type command sed -n ‘s/ridge high point/r.h.p./p’ mountainList.txt and execute it. Then attach a screenshot of the output. 
C. Open the manual page of sed and describe what does –n do in 
sed? -n, --quiet, --silent --- suppress automatic printing of pattern space D. Describe what does the sed command in (B) do? 
It replaces all the instances of “ridge high point” with “r.h.p” and prints the changed outputs. 
5) Use sed to remove the leading spaces in "mountainList.txt" and print out the processed lines. 
sed 's/^ *//' mountainList.txt 
6) Finish task 5) and save the output to file "newList.txt". 
sed 's/^ *//' mountainList.txt>newList.txt 
7) Use sed to list the lines beginning with white spaces in 
"mountainList.txt". Sample Output 
sed -n -e '/^ /p' mountainList.txt 
2
8) Use sed to delete the lines where the mountains are only at Union County 
in "mountainList.txt". 
sed -n '/Union County/!p' mountainList.txt 
Sample Output 
9) Use sed to remove the middle three fields in each line of 
"mountainList.txt". Hint: Think about the meaning of regex 
'[^,]' sed -r 's/,([^,]*){3},/,/g' public/mountainList.txt 
sed 's/,[^,]*,[^,]*,[^,]*,/,/' mountainList.txt 
Sample Output 

10) Use awk to finish task 9). 
awk -F',' 'BEGIN{OFS=","}{ print $1,$5}' mountainList.txt 
11) Use sed to insert a new line “Table: Eleven highest mountains in Georgia” at the beginning of "mountainList.txt".
sed '1i Table:Eleven highest mountains in Georgia' mountainList.txt 
12) Use sort to print out the sorted lines in alphabetical order according to the names of mountains. 
sort +0 -2 mountainList.txt 
13) Use sort to print out the sorted lines in descending order according to the height of mountains. 
sort -t "," -r -nk 3,3 mountainList.txt 
14) “When a pattern groups all or part of its content into a pair of parentheses, it captures that content and stores it temporarily in memory. You can reuse that content if you wish by using a back-reference, in the form:\1 or $1, where \1 or $1 reference the first captured group” (Refer to [1]). For example, the following command add a colon between Union and County 
sed -E ‘s/(Union)\s(County)/\1:\2/g’ mountainList.txt 
Attach a screenshot of the output of the above sed command.

15) Now can you write a command to finish task 9) using sed with back reference? 
sed -E 's/,.*,/,/' mountainList.txt
